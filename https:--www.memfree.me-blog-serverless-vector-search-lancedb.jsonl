In order to reduce maintenance costs, serverless is very important, which is also the first goal of my design. However, using ordinary S3 storage will result in high latency. So in order to achieve serverless and maintain high performance, I used S3 Express One Zone.","vector":[-0.0341181,0.025787307,-0.030366063,-0.00982525,0.012384903,-0.04228991,0.011828456,0.112243146,-0.09946078,0.07065277,0.078029655,0.004785437,0.0017995072,-0.042130925,0.07904716,0.054436337,-0.006204375,-0.07052558,-0.016168736,-0.06715511,0.023434334,0.00091316795,-0.026311954,-0.024881095,0.04044569,0.044960853,-0.004829158,0.051956177,-0.064261585,-0.033100598,0.065946825,0.038919438,-0.03176513,0.011216366,-0.0038315295,-0.10575657,0.06836339,-0.027552035,-0.067854635,0.057329856,-0.038315296,-0.0372342,-0.0651201,0.064484164,0.07421403,0.03952358,-0.06734589,0.081463724,-0.02543754,-0.017806279,-0.020811087,-0.04880828,0.06810901,0.004562859,-0.05812478,-0.0020966097,-0.0032373245,0.10461188,0.052655708,-0.046041947,0.07911075,-0.100351095,-0.0071741813,-0.032941613,-0.017377019,-0.015691783,-0.018489912,0.067981824,-0.06365744,-0.025962189,-0.04817234,-0.024865195,0.03949178,0.023911288,-0.019571008,-0.025310352,0.08407107,0.07097074,0.03577154,0.032416966,0.053641412,-0.07408684,0.0070589175,-0.017313426,0.10391235,-0.027599731,-0.13113052,-0.12858677,0.071479484,0.012249765,-0.055294853,-0.067854635,0.009356245,-0.07058917,0.044388507,0.07154308,-0.042957645,0.0078101195,-0.032210287,0.028299263,-0.02834696,0.07402324,-0.12152785,-0.079873875,0.04480187,0.026788909,0.0237841,0.06473854,0.050143752,0.044070538,-0.0060533397,-0.016057447,0.0017726786,-0.022082964,-0.046773277,-0.08597889,0.0175837,-0.059619233,0.029237272,0.0034658648,0.060318768,0.03453146,-0.02543754,-0.06556526,-0.05914228,0.01850581,0.043498192,-0.028966999,0.051924378,0.00858517,-0.02833106,0.030636337,-0.033132397,-0.017440613,0.045088038,0.06912652,0.11415096,0.074722774,-0.014555043,0.03081122,-0.010604274,-0.09291062,-0.013950901,0.0036705576,-0.021176752,0.022051167,-0.047313824,0.004785437,0.012599532,-0.028680826,-0.0022893785,-0.060414158,0.029905008,0.01530227,0.07713934,0.0141019365,-0.009459585,-0.029125983,0.02906239,0.10353079,0.033132397,-0.018696591,-0.028871607,0.050175548,-0.0011605878,0.065946825,0.028013092,-0.005544589,-0.07154308,0.030238876,0.1405424,0.07911075,0.044102333,0.028362857,-0.028521841,-0.05510407,0.08725076,-0.088331856,0.005810888,0.020922376,-0.012011289,0.031129189,0.006379258,0.02130394,-0.0037719102,0.007973079,0.0005291207,-0.02709098,0.033132397,0.0050000665,0.055771805,0.037361387,0.11707628,0.038378887,-0.012750567,-0.016454909,0.040604673,-0.04197194,-0.023482028,0.005008016,-0.033354975,0.00028095563,-0.015222778,-0.0014298679,-0.050207343,-0.025676018,0.04197194,-0.040859047,0.022194253,0.020524915,0.04725023,0.028919304,-0.019904874,-0.042766865,0.03764756,0.014857113,-0.017011356,-0.020032063,-0.09367374,-0.11179799,-0.021160854,-0.023020973,0.032289777,0.021828588,-0.04601015,-0.02109726,-0.08184528,0.0049801935,0.08031903,-0.0068840343,0.009093921,-0.028903404,0.016534401,-0.052369535,-0.0032114894,-0.10461188,0.0015858717,-0.091702335,-0.088141076,-0.050843284,-0.083371535,0.04124061,-0.002064813,-0.04518343,-0.074722774,-0.029125983,0.014205276,0.11275189,0.06995323,-0.026534533,-0.03669365,-0.011057381,0.021892183,0.044420306,0.035230994,0.018950967,0.01198744,-0.078411214,-0.047727186,-0.0558354,-0.051638205,-0.010365797,-0.08934936,0.061081894,-0.066137604,-0.11612237,0.022400934,-0.018791983,0.01662979,0.052782897,0.06899933,-0.081336536,0.003479776,-0.03319599,0.051034063,-0.028283365,-0.069635265,0.034372475,0.033354975,-0.065946825,-0.017329324,0.00992859,0.02926907,-0.050906878,-0.045787573,-0.06556526,-0.01417348,-0.0455014,-0.014006546,0.0073013688,-0.042353503,-0.035548963,0.00003819357,0.046582494,0.030111687,-0.0037421007,0.11415096,-0.017806279,0.006391182,0.028060786,-0.0066813286,-0.009149565,0.034913022,-0.009395991,-0.052369535,0.004467468,-0.098634064,-0.01592231,-0.026629925,-0.03787014,0.12680614,0.023307147,0.056821104,-0.124516755,0.08362591,0.08044622,0.030000398,0.030048095,-0.046041947,-0.021796793,0.0940553,-0.03538998,-0.12534347,0.014133733,0.0038056944,-0.041558582,0.053069066,-0.006383233,0.018028857,-0.00016730648,-0.029523445,-0.03049325,-0.049189843,0.08566092,0.0021681527,-0.05761603,-0.057202667,0.021860385,0.06111369,0.025596526,0.07828403,-0.07828403,-0.008124114,0.079683095,0.023625115,0.045914758,-0.076058246,0.005504843,0.038919438,-0.042162724,0.0018919171,0.0021999497,-0.02192398,-0.07631262,0.04674148,-0.010707615,-0.005504843,-0.024117967,0.007921409,0.11523206,0.018362723,-0.016041549,-0.05984181,0.11535925,-0.0017498245,0.035835136,0.07669418,0.025930392,0.048967265,0.002291366,-0.06197221,0.05033453,-0.044293117,-0.0151432855,-0.09678984,-0.02605758,0.0796195,-0.008736205,0.036025915,0.06314869,-0.011081228,0.03364115,-0.01519893,0.011764863]}

In order to obtain the overall low latency of vector search, the latency of embedding must also be very low. In my previous blog, I introduced how to build an emebeeding service with **a few milliseconds**.

Similar to all column-based databases, to achieve the best query performance, we need to compact small files in a timely manner. The problem here is that Lancedb does not officially expose an API for the number of versions. To solve this problem, I introduced **upstash redis**.
